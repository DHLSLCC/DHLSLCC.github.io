Water is the most important resource in existence. It gives life, It hydrates, it cleans, and even helps the transportation of other resources, be it on oceans or rivers. But there is a problem. Water in Utah has always been a scarce resource, now more than ever. People are also using much more water than necessary. From watering lawns to leaving taps on. There is a drought and because of it water is more precious than it may ever have been. There is a problem. We need to address it. There’s something we can do.
</p>
<p>
Utah has been in varying degrees of drought since the year 2000 as recorded by the US Drought Monitor (drought.gov). Information for the US Drought Monitor is gathered from recorded “temperatures, soil moisture, water levels in streams and lakes, snow cover, and meltwater runoff” (drought.gov). Though drought for Utah may be consistent, that doesn’t mean it is not a problem. Now we are facing one of the worst droughts in many years. According to KSL news this is the worst drought since 1895 and in 2020 received only “an average of 7.24 inches statewide” compared to the “13.56 inches [averaged] throughout the 20th century” (Williams).
</p>
<p>
Acknowledging a problem is one of the first steps to solving problems. Just look outside. The mountains are brown and dead. Reservoir and lake water levels are low. “Since 2000, the lake's surface has dropped by a hundred and forty feet. Just in the past year, it's dropped by fifty feet” (Kolbert). There is no denying that there is a problem. It is imperative that it is acknowledged.
</p>
<p>
Learning about where our water comes from is an important part of becoming knowledgeable about drought and water conservation. According to the organization American Rivers the majority of the water consumed by Utah populations comes from seasonally dependent headwater streams (American Rivers). These streams in Utah are primarily fed by snow and ice. Though we can’t control how much snow and rain we get we can control how much water we use.
</p>
<p>
So how can we control our water usage? I’m almost certain that most everyone has heard of the usual examples such as turning off the water while brushing teeth and taking shorter showers but the thing is that it actually helps. The “average flow rate of 2.1 gallons per minute” (sugargroveil.gov). Even just taking two minutes less in the shower can save 4.2 gallons of water. You’re not using that water while you’re brushing your teeth. You can take shorter showers. But there is more you can do. American Rivers says you can save water by doing things like “Only [running] the washing machine and dishwasher when you have a full load [and monitoring] your water usage on your water bill and [asking] your local government about a home water audits” (American Rivers). Another thing you can do is water your lawn responsibly. Water your lawn when it is cooler outside and do so less regularly. After all, “30 to 60% of domestic drinking water is used to water yards and gardens” (American Rivers). Go do some research of your own.
</p>
<p>
The drought in Utah isn’t some problem to be ignored or put off. We are experiencing one worse than ever. Reservoir levels have dropped significantly. We just haven’t gotten enough snow to replenish what we use. Water conservation is a real issue that can and will have a negative effect in our lifetimes. But it doesn’t have to. You don’t need to change your entire lifestyle to save water. You can shower for shorter times, turn off water when you’re not using it, and take a few minutes to change your sprinkler schedule. People can help save water by learning, researching and using it more responsibly. Will you?
