The driveway always had an issue with flooding in heavy rain. Much of the time this was simply entertaining as it caused no real threat to the house. On August 1st, I stood in the neighbors driveway eating a creamie. Clouds rolled in and some raindrops fell. Thunder and lightning shortly followed. Some talk of lightning came up between my neighbors and family members.
</p>
<p>
“Lighting is just kisses from the universe,” my brother Reuel said.
</p>
<p>
“Buy me dinner first!” I yelled toward the sky. Right after yelling lightning flashed across the sky. I guess the universe didn’t like my answer. The rain grew heavier and so we and our neighbors retreated to our homes. We were excited for the rain, after all “2020 had been one of the driest years since 1895” and 2021 wasn’t looking much better (Williams). Though the rain was helpful for the drought, its effects only really lasted a week, so it was still really important to make sure we were saving water.
</p>
<p>
The rain fell harder as the minutes went past. The sound on the roof went from a pleasant sound to a roar as if the storm itself was a mythical beast screaming as it violently defecated rain across the landscape. 
</p>
<p>
“Oh no. The driveway’s flooding!” my mom said in a rather unsurprised tone. (It is a pretty normal occurrence at this point so we’re all desensitized to it)
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go get the squeegee!” I said as I was rushing to the garage after grabbing my crocs and raincoat. After searching for the squeegee for a bit I gave up. At this point the situation was getting pretty bad. My dad and brother were at the back door with a shop vacuum as the area surrounding the back door tended to flood as well.
</p>
<p>
I rushed outside through the front door where my mom and sibling Sarah were grabbing snow shovels to bail the water with. My mom handed me a shovel.
</p>
<p>
“Use this to get the water onto the lawn!”
</p>
<p>
“Ok.”
</p>
<p>
I took the shovel, thrust it into the deep water that was still creeping up the driveway, and to my surprise the head of the shovel fell off. I hurried and grabbed a different shovel and began pushing the water onto the lawn. This was important as we were the only thing keeping water away from the garage. After all, it would only have one place to go after that. Into the house.
</p>
<p>
“Is it weird at all that this is exciting and in a way kind of fun?” I asked Sarah.
</p>
<p>
“Not really,” They said.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully our neighbors, from each side of our house, saw our mighty struggle and came to help with shovels of their own and a Home Depot bucket. Soon after the situation was under control and the rain was fading. I laughed as I stood in the water reaching just above my ankles.
</p>
<p>
“You know, it’s probably acid rain because of all the smoke in the air,” Sarah declared.
</p>
<p>
“You’re probably right,” I said, “Well would you look at that it’s already bleached my ankles.”
