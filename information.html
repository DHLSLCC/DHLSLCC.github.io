<h1>A Drought Like No Other</h1>

<div class="nIndent">
<p>
A constant ongoing need for water is present within all communities and peoples. Every area has differing amounts of accessible water and some people act differently according to that access. Historically Utah has been a dry region. As populations increase in Utah more water is needed to sustain the people. Now a new drought is present and the need for water is growing.
</p>
<p>
For decades Utah has been facing droughts. According to precipitation records, the year “2020 was the driest year since at least 1895” (Williams). This statement was drawn from the statistics that showed that in the year 2020 Utah received “an average of 7.24 inches [of water] statewide,” compared to the average of 13.56 inches of water throughout the nineteen-hundreds (Williams). With this significant lack of precipitation, soil moisture levels are the driest they have ever been recorded (Williams). But it’s not only soil moisture being affected.
</p>
<p>
The drought’s effect is growing to an immense size. Many reservoirs are slowly being emptied. In June of 2021 “Utah's governor, Spencer Cox, announced… ‘We need more rain and we need it now’”(Kolbert). Kolbert in her paper,“The Lost Canyon”, talks about her trip to Lake Powell in recent times when the water level is much lower because of the drought. Kolbert describes:
</p>
</div>
<p class="blockQ">
Along the rock, parallel to the surface of the lake, stretched an unbroken band of white, straight as a ruler. Everywhere you go on Lake Powell, this band is visible. It's made of minerals that the reservoir deposited on the sandstone when it was full and that have been exposed as the water level has dropped. Known as the "bathtub ring," it is now the height of the Statue of Liberty.
</p>
<p>
Such a drop in water level accounts for a huge amount of water that has been restored to the reservoir. Lake Powell holds “twenty-four million acre-feet of water,” or 29,603,520,000 cubic meters (Kolbert). This shows how severe the current drought is in Utah. Even though most of the water held at the Glen Canyon Dam is used as a buffer for other reservoirs it really goes to show how much water is available for use in total.
</p>
<p class="nIndent">
Water usage is an important aspect of water conservation. Knowing how much water is being used and how much is available is important to create a sustainable balance. Emma Penrod says:
</p>
<p class="blockQ">
It might seem as though measuring water use would be a relatively simple affair—you slap a water meter on some houses, take some readings, and tally up the total use for a given area. In reality, it’s not quite that simple (Penrod 2).
</p>
<p>
Reasons for this are complex but can often be attributed to simple things such as leaky pipes. But measuring water use isn’t the only problem. Utahns are getting more efficient with their water use, but the population is increasing. More people who need water means more water used. “According to state water data, Utah consumed just shy of 790,000 acre-feet of water in 2015. By 2018, water use had escalated to more than 870,000 acre-feet per year” (Penrod 3). Statistics show that water usage is increasing likely due to population growth, and according to these trends we could assume that consumption of water will continue to grow with the population. Because of this people will need to try and save water.
</p>
<div class="nIndent">
<p>
With an increasing demand and shrinking supply there have been many efforts made to conserve water. One such effort is the Water Conservation Initiative. Although it was created before the current drought it still is relevant and shows that water conservation is not a new issue. To help with water conservation the Water Conservation Initiative has created several efforts, one such is the Water Check Program. Which “provides free sprinkler system tests for homeowners and businesses, measuring the amount of water landscapes receive and providing individual watering schedules” (“Water Conservation Initiative” 3). Other efforts include programs for education to teach people how to save water, mapping to show water use and solutions, and The Center for Water-Efficient Landscaping. And now modern efforts are being made. The 33 billion dollar plan is an example. The plan was created in 2013 by Governor Herbert appointing “a Water Resource Advisory Team to bring all interested parties together to create a strategic, water-planning roadmap (Francom 2). The plan is intended to plan for the future methods and strategies to help with water conservation. It is an ongoing process.
</p>
<p>
Drought has been an issue for years in Utah and much of the world for centuries or quite possibly milenia. Currently in the year 2021 Utah is facing one of the worst droughts in 125 years. Because of this drought there is less water available for a growing population. There is less water in reservoirs, lakes and the ground. Everyone needs water and that is why there have so many efforts to conserve it. After all, it keeps us alive.
