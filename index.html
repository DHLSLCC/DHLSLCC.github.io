<h1>Editors Note (Draft)</h1>
<p>
Hello and welcome to you fine reader! Thank you for your time. This magazine “Years of Drought” discusses the topic of water conservation in the state of Utah. The beginnings of the magazine started back at the beginning of my English 2010 class when we were to choose a local issue to talk about. I wanted to choose something that I had actually experienced or knew something about. While brainstorming I thought about an experience I had with my home’s driveway flooding. I decided it would be fun and exciting to tell and so I used the story for my <a href="memoir.html">Flash Memoir</a>. The memoir I decided nicely tied into the issue of drought in Utah. I decided to make this the issue I talked about as it was current and relevant. 
</p>
<p>
In this magazine I have compiled together several of my projects. The first being my <a href="memoir.html">Flash Memoir</a> which I decided to adapt into an audio format. I did this so then the audience would be able to hear the emotion and storytelling instead of just reading it. There’s nothing wrong with reading it just sounded like it would be more engaging. The <a href="memoir.html">Memoir</a> shares a story of a torrential summer downpour and the struggles of me, my family, and neighbors trying to prevent the water from flooding from the driveway into my house. I wrote it in a way that I hope captures both the stress, but also the humor and fun of the situation. I intend for the <a href="memoir.html">Memoir</a> to be an entertaining story which can easily introduce the issue of water conservation to people.
</p>
<p>
Another project I have included is my <a href="information.html">Information Effect Project</a>. This project took quite a lot of time to create as I wanted to get my information from more academic sources but also current sources. The issue with this is that finding academic papers from the past two years is quite a challenge. In the end I was able to find what I needed and write the paper. The <a href="information.html">Information Effect Project</a> is a paper that gives a series of summaries, facts and evidences, and solutions for water conservation. I hope for it to be a beneficial way to inform you about the current state of drought and conservation efforts.
</p>
<p>
My <a href="persuasion.html">Persuasion Effect Project</a> I made to both inform and to persuade people of my point. One observation I had made throughout the duration of making these projects is that very few people seem to even know that water conservation is even an issue. Sure I could tell most people knew we were in a drought, but they just didn’t seem to care. The <a href="persuasion.html">Persuasion Effect</a> paper is structured in a way that it first convinces and informs about the problem and then I try to convince people to do something. 
</p>
<p>
I hope that my writing here doesn’t sound like some crazy dude rambling about something he’s done. Please go and listen to or read something I made. I hope you enjoy it. I certainly had a good time making it.
