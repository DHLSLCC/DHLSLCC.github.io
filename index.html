Hello and welcome to you fine reader! Thank you for your time. This magazine “Name to be determined” discusses the topic of water conservation in the state of Utah. The beginnings of the magazine started back at the beginning of my English 2010 class when we were to choose a local issue to talk about. I wanted to choose something that I had actually experienced or knew something about. While brainstorming I thought about an experience I had with my home’s driveway flooding. I decided it would be fun and exciting to tell and so I used the story for my Flash Memoir. The memoir I decided nicely tied into the issue of drought in Utah. I decided to make this the issue I talked about as it was current and relevant. 
</p>
<p>
I had always known somewhat that drought was an issue in Utah. Much of Utah is a desert after all. When I got started researching water conservation I started to learn a lot I hadn’t known before. Turns out it is quite the issue. I also learned that you can’t measure water usage very easily (just a fun fact). At first I wasn’t terribly interested in my topic. I had just heard so much about water conservation I had begun to tune it out. Studying and writing about water really began to peak my interest on the subject. As I wrote each project I began to be more and more excited about it. I did enjoy writing my narrative the most though. Writing really can make one interested about what they are writing about, in this case, water conservation.
</p>
<p>
If I were asked to make a short introduction to water conservation and drought I would begin by telling people about the source of water in the region. Water in Utah comes most plentifully from snow. The current drought I talk about in these projects mainly focuses on the 2020-2021 drought while acknowledging that that wasn’t the beginning. The drought started with quite a dry year where very little snow fell. Now because of it the available amount of water has diminished. Now because of it we as consumers of water have the responsibility to save it.
</p>
<p>
This magazine is composed of three of my projects. The first being my Flash Memoir which as mentioned earlier is about my driveway flooding. Sure it doesn’t talk a whole lot about water conservation but I feel like it is a good way  to introduce the topic to you. It’s fun and a bit stressful and I hope you might enjoy it as much as I enjoyed writing it (believe me I actually had fun writing it). 
</p>
<p>
There is also my Information Effect project in which I have written what I hope to be somewhat enlightening on the subject of drought. There is also my Persuasion Effect which gives a summary of the problem and hopefully will call you and others to action.
</p>
<p>
Now that I have done a bunch of talking I will wrap things up and let you go on your way. I hope you enjoy reading or listening to my projects and I hope my voice doesn’t put you to sleep. But why only stop here. Maybe go learn some more elsewhere. Other people also have great things to say.
